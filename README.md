# Pharmacology_101_Trivia


This will be a simple, quiz style game designed for learning types of medications/drugs and their uses, adverse effects, brand name vs. generic name, drug class, etc. The program will allow the user to run this game in Python IDLE. This game will include questions that a beginner will be able to understand and answer. The drugs are sorted by categories (cardiac, respiratory, neuro, diabetes).

The target demographic would be healthcare/nursing students and healthcare professionals looking to become more knowledgeable when it comes to administering drugs and prescribing medications. However, I believe that patients can benefit from using this game as well. Patient education is a key factor to compliance when it comes to keeping the routine of taking prescribed medications on schedule.
